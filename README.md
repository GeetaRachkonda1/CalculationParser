## CalculationParser
A simple work in progress calculation parser, written in C++.

## How to use
Simply download 'Main.cpp' and 'LICENSE.md' and use them in your projects. The main file already contains a simple demo, so you theoretically can just compile it to get a console window where you can enter your calculation and its result will be returned.
